3D Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise in Processing using minim 

Minim Library is required to run.

The z-index is determined by the beat of the song, I included the file I originally created the sketch with, but you can change that by adding in your own song file to the sketch folder and renaming the file name on line 37.

The beat sensitivity is currently set at 300 on line 51, but you can change that to whatever you'd prefer.
After a beat has been detected, the algorithm will wait for 300 milliseconds before allowing another beat to be reported. You can use this to dampen the algorithm if it is giving too many false-positives
